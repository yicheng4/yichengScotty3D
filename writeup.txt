I first implemented erase edge and then I used it later. 
For the edge flip I delete the original edge and added new four edges and a new vertex.
For the edge collapse, what I did is to go to the neighboring vertices and see if they are overlapping, if there is overlapping vertices I will delete the edge and finally combine them by collapsing them together.
For for the face bevel what I did is to assign new address and positions.
